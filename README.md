# Hello, Copilot!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Copilot!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-copilot) blog post. 

This episode: AWS Copilot command line container deployment. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce AWS Copilot and use it to deploy and manage a "Hello, Cloud" .NET API container from the command line. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Copilot Project

In this tutorial you will create a .NET web API that converts between units of measurement. We'll use Copilot to deploy it as a container to AWS App Runner. Then we'll update the service and see how to use Copilot to deploy the update.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
